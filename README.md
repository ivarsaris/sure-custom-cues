Sure Custom Cues

First milestone project; User-centric frontend development - Code Institute

This website is made for Sure Custom Cues, a small pool cuemaking business located in Cologne, Germany. The website has five pages using various technologies;

1. Homepage: Introduces the company and has an automatic slideshow with images of cues.
2. About page: Explains the philosophy and tells the story of the company.  
3. Innovations page: Gives an overview of all innovations developed by Sure Custom Cues.
4. Custom cues page: Gives and overview of the custom cues currently for sale and a gallery of cues made.
5. Impressum: An overview of information about the company in order to comply with German law.


UX

The goal of the website is to give visitors a clear image of the work that Sure Custom Cues does. As well as showcasing what Sure Custom Cues
offers for sale. Besides this, the philosophy is explained and the history of the business is told. On every page, there's a bar at the top with 
contact information of the business and links to its social media accounts. 

The goal of the design was to make it easy for visitors to find and access any part of the website. The dark background and light text in modern font
was chosen to create a modern style. This was one of the wishes of Andreas Sure, director of Sure Custom Cues. 

I started by creating a mockup using Wix: https://ivarsaris.wixsite.com/mysite.


Features

The homepage features a slideshow created with a keyframes query in CSS. 

Several images, including the gallery images, double in size when they are hovered. This was achieved by using the transform function in CSS.

Features left to implement

In the future, I would like to make a slideshow for each custom cue for sale. So potential customers can slide through
three or four pictures and better look at the cue. Also, I would like to add a section with videos which show the 
innovations and cues being tested.
